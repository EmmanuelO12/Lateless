            <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>
                By downloading, installing, or using the Lateless mobile application ("App"), you agree to 
                be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please 
                do not use the App.
            </p>

            <h2>Description of Service</h2>
            <p>
                Lateless is a departure time planning application that helps you arrive on time to your 
                appointments. The App calculates when you should leave based on your location, destination, 
                traffic conditions, and transit schedules.
            </p>

            <h2>Use of the App</h2>
            <p>You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the App in any way that violates any applicable laws or regulations</li>
                <li>Attempt to interfere with or disrupt the App's functionality</li>
                <li>Use the App while operating a vehicle or in any situation where distraction could be dangerous</li>
                <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
            <p>
                While we strive to provide accurate departure times and travel estimates, we cannot guarantee 
                their accuracy. Traffic conditions, transit schedules, and other factors can change unexpectedly. 
                <strong>You are responsible for allowing adequate time for your journeys.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The App should be used as a helpful tool, not as the sole basis for time-critical decisions. 
                We recommend building in extra buffer time for important appointments.
            </p>

            <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

                <li><strong>Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period</li>
